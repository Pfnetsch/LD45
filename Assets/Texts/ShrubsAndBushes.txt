Shrubs play a major role in preventing water and soil erosion. Shrubs also provide food and shelter for a wide variety of insects, birds and other animals.
They can re-sprout easily after fires or other disturbances and grow to mature size much faster than trees.
They share nutrients and information with other plants, shelter microbes in return for nitrogen and other nutrients, and thus contribute to a healthy, biodiverse, carbon-sequestering soil system.
Some kinds of shrubs even act as nurse species, so that young trees grow better in their company. Their many leaves and stems make them efficient photosynthesis factories, pulling carbon out of the air.
