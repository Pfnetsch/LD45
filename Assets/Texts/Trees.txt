Trees are considered nature’s most efficient “carbon sinks.” According to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), tree species that grow quickly and live long are ideal to store carbon. In general, pines and oaks are great. Deciduous trees are absorbing in average 50 % more carbon dioxide than coniferous trees. Trees also provide food and shelter for a wide variety of insects, birds and other animals.
