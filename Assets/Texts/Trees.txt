Trees are considered nature’s most efficient “carbon sinks.”
According to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), tree species that grow quickly and live long are ideal to store carbon. In general, pines and oaks are great.
Deciduous trees are absorbing in average 50 % more carbon dioxide than coniferous trees. Trees also provide food and shelter for a wide variety of insects, birds and other animals.

Planting Trees has a wide range of positive effects. They provide shade and cool down their surroundings.
Like shrubs, the root help soil hold together and decrease erosion. The vast root structures hold onto water which strengthens the surrounding ecosystems and decrease the chance of floods.
Before planting a tree, surrounding grass and big stones should be removed. Gras withdraws water from the soil and is especially adverse for young trees.
