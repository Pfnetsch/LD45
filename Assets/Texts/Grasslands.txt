In a stable climate, trees store more carbon than grasslands, but in vulnerable, warming, drought-likely landscapes grasslands and rangelands are more resilient carbon sinks than forests. Grasslands sequester most of their carbon underground, while forests store it mostly in woody biomass and leaves. When wildfires cause trees to go up in flames, the burned carbon they formerly stored is released back to the atmosphere. When fire burns grasslands, however, the carbon fixed underground tends to stay in the roots and soil, making them more adaptive to climate change.
